=head1 NAME

Tree::Binary2 - An implementation of a binary tree

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $tree = Tree::Binary2->new( 'root' );

  my $left = Tree::Binary2->new( 'left' );
  $tree->left( $left );

  my $right = Tree::Binary2->new( 'left' );
  $tree->right( $right );

  my $right_child = $tree->right;

  $tree->right( undef ); # Unset the right child.

  my @nodes = $tree->traverse( $tree->POST_ORDER );

  my $traversal = $tree->traverse( $tree->IN_ORDER );
  while ( my $node = $traversal->() ) {
      # Do something with $node here
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an implementation of a binary tree. This class inherits from L<Tree>,
which is an N-ary tree implemenation. Because of this, this class actually
provides an implementation of a complete binary tree vs. a sparse binary tree.
The empty nodes are instances of Tree::Null, which is described in L<Tree>.
This should have no effect on your usage of this class.

=head1 METHODS

In addition to the methods provided by L<Tree>, the following items are
provided or overriden.

=over 4

=item * C<left([$child])> / C<right([$child])>

These access the left and right children, respectively. They are mutators,
which means that their behavior changes depending on if you pass in a value.

If you do not pass in any parameters, then it will act as a getter for the
specific child, return the child (if set) or undef (if not).

If you pass in a child, it will act as a setter for the specific child,
setting the child to the passed-in value and returning the $tree. (Thus, this
method chains.)

If you wish to unset the child, do C<$treeE<gt>left( undef );>

=item * C<children()>

This will return the children of the tree.

B<NOTE:> There will be two children, always. Tree::Binary2 implements a
complete binary tree, filling in missing children with Tree::Null objects.
(Please see L<Tree::Fast> for more information on Tree::Null.)

=item * B<traverse( [$order] )>

When called in list context (C<my @traversal = $tree-E<gt>traverse()>), this will
return a list of the nodes in the given traversal order. When called in scalar
context (C<my $traversal = $tree-E<gt>traverse()>), this will return a closure
that will, over successive calls, iterate over the nodes in the given
traversal order. When finished it will return false.

The default traversal order is pre-order.

In addition to the traversal orders provided by L<Tree>, Tree::Binary2 provides
in-order traversals.

=over 4

=item * In-order

This will return the result of an in-order traversal on the left node (if
any), then the node, then the result of an in-order traversal on the right
node (if any).

=back

=back

B<NOTE:> You have access to all the methods provided by L<Tree>, but it is not
recommended that you use many of them, unless you know what you're doing. This
list includes C<add_child()> and C<remove_child()>.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item * Make in-order closure traversal work iteratively

=item * Make post-order closure traversal work iteratively

=back
