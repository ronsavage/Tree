=head1 NAME

Tree::Fast - the fastest possible implementation of a tree in pure Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $tree = Tree::Fast->new( 'root' );
  my $child = Tree::Fast->new( 'child' );
  $tree->add_child( {}, $child );

  $tree->add_child( { at => 0 }, Tree::Fast->new( 'first child' ) );
  $tree->add_child( { at => -1 }, Tree::Fast->new( 'last child' ) );

  my @children = $tree->children;
  my @some_children = $tree->children( 0, 2 );

  $tree->remove_child( 0 );

  my @nodes = $tree->traverse( $tree->POST_ORDER );

  my $traversal = $tree->traverse( $tree->POST_ORDER );
  while ( my $node = $traversal->() ) {
      # Do something with $node here
  }

  my $clone = $tree->clone;
  my $mirror = $tree->clone->mirror;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is meant to be the core implementation for L<Tree>, stripped down as much
as possible. There is no error-checking, bounds-checking, event-handling,
convenience methods, or anything else of the sort. If you want something fuller-featured,
please look at L<Tree>, which is a wrapper around Tree::Fast.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=head2 new([$value])

Here, [] indicate an optional parameter.

This will return a C<Tree::Fast> object. It will accept one parameter which, if passed,
will become the I<value> (accessible by C<value()>). All other parameters will be
ignored.

If you call C<< $tree->new([$value]) >>, it will instead call C<clone()>, then set
the I<value> of the clone to $value.

=head2 clone()

This will return a clone of C<$tree>. The clone will be a root tree, but all
children will be cloned.

If you call C<< Tree::Fast->clone([$value]) >>, it will instead call C<new()>.

B<NOTE:> the value is merely a shallow copy. This means that all references
will be kept.

=head2 Behaviors

=head2 add_child($options, @nodes)

This will add all the C<@nodes> as children of C<$tree>. C<$options> is a required
hashref that specifies options for C<add_child()>. The optional parameters are:

=over 4

=item * at

This specifies the index to add C<@nodes> at. If specified, this will be passed
into splice(). The only exceptions are if this is 0, it will act as an
unshift(). If it is unset or undefined, it will act as a push().

=back

=head2 remove_child($options, @nodes)

This will remove all the C<@nodes> from the children of C<$tree>. You can either
pass in the actual child object you wish to remove, the index of the child you
wish to remove, or a combination of both.

$options is a required hashref that specifies parameters for remove_child().
Currently, no parameters are used.

=head2 mirror()

This will modify the tree such that it is a mirror of what it was before. This
means that the order of all children is reversed.

B<NOTE>: This is a destructive action. It I<will> modify the internal
structure of the tree. If you wish to get a mirror, yet keep the original tree intact, use
C<< my $mirror = $tree->clone->mirror >>.

=head2 traverse( [$order] )

Here, [] indicate an optional parameter.

When called in list context (C<< my @traversal = $tree->traverse() >>), this will
return a list of the nodes in the given traversal order. When called in scalar
context (C<< my $traversal = $tree->traverse() >>), this will return a closure
that will, over successive calls, iterate over the nodes in the given
traversal order. When finished it will return false.

The default traversal order is pre-order.

The various traversal orders do the following steps:

=over 4

=item * Pre-order

This will return the node, then the first sub tree in pre-order traversal,
then the next sub tree, etc.

Use C<< $tree->PRE_ORDER >> as the C<$order>.

=item * Post-order

This will return the each sub-tree in post-order traversal, then the node.

Use C<< $tree->POST_ORDER >> as the C<$order>.

=item * Level-order

This will return the node, then the all children of the node, then all
grandchildren of the node, etc.

Use C<< $tree->LEVEL_ORDER >> as the C<$order>.

=back

=head2 Accessors

=head2 parent()

This will return the parent of C<$tree>.

=head2 children( [ $idx, [$idx, ..] ] )

Here, [] indicate optional parameters.

This will return the children of C<$tree>. If called in list context, it will
return all the children. If called in scalar context, it will return the
number of children.

You may optionally pass in a list of indices to retrieve. This will return the
children in the order you asked for them. This is very much like an
arrayslice.

=head2 value()

This will return the value stored in the node.

=head2 set_value([$value])

Here, [] indicate an optional parameter.

This will set the I<value> stored in the node to $value, then return $self.

If C<$value> is not provided, undef is used.

=head2 meta()

This will return a hashref that can be used to store whatever metadata the client
wishes to store. For example, L<Tree::Persist::DB> uses this to store database
row ids.

It is recommended that you store your metadata in a subhashref and not in the
top-level metadata hashref, keyed by your package name. L<Tree::Persist> does
this, using a unique key for each persistence layer associated with that tree.
This will help prevent clobbering of metadata.

=head1 NULL TREE

If you call C<< $self->parent >> on a root node, it will return a Tree::Null
object. This is an implementation of the Null Object pattern optimized for
usage with L<Tree::Fast>. It will evaluate as false in every case (using
I<overload>) and all methods called on it will return a Tree::Null object.

=head2 Notes

=over 4

=item *

Tree::Null does B<not> inherit from anything. This is so that all the
methods will go through AUTOLOAD vs. the actual method.

=item *

However, calling isa() on a Tree::Null object will report that it is-a
any object that is either Tree or in the Tree:: hierarchy.

=item *

The Tree::Null object is a singleton.

=item *

The Tree::Null object I<is> defined, though. I could not find a way to
make it evaluate as undefined. That may be a good thing.
