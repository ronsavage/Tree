		http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/My.Workflow.for.Building.Distros.html.
	- Update .gitignore and MANIFEST.SKIP.
	- Move various modules to TEST_REQUIRES within Makefile.PL.
	- Update version #s in pre-reqs.

1.08  2016-04-21T10:54:00
	- No code changes.
	- Overwrite the file LICENSE with the Perl licence, to make it compatible with the statement in
		Tree.pm. This corrects a mistake made by me (Ron).
	- Reformat the dates in this file.
	- Move the files t/pod_coverage.t and t/pod.t into xt/author/.
	- Remove .gitignore from MANFIEST and put it in MANIFEST.SKIP.

1.07  2014-01-10T21:39:00
	- Not released
	- Integrate with github.
	- Make Build.PL and Makefile.PL look like all my other ones, including using strict and
		warnings.

1.06  2014-01-09T13:24:00
	- Add methods and docs for tree2string(), node2string(), format_node(), hashref2string().
		Only tree2string() is normally called by end users.

1.05  2014-06-05T08:34:00
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs base, constant and overload, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Requested by Andreas Mock. Actually, I should have done this with version 1.04.
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

1.04  2012-11-08T12:38:00
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.
	- Add README.

1.03  2012-11-02T09:34:00
	- Rename Tree::Binary to Tree::Binary2 so it no longer clashes with the Tree::Binary shipped in the
		Tree-Binary distro. MetaCPAN was getting confused, and automatically redirected links to this
		module's Tree:Binary to the other one.

1.02  2012-10-04T12:10:00
	- Ron Savage is now co-maint.
	- Patch Tree::Fast's value() to accept a defained value so the node's value can be set with
		$n -> value($new_value).
	- Patch Tree::Fast's meta() to accept a hashref so metadata can be set with $n -> meta({key => value}),
		as well as by directly accessing the internal hashref '_meta'.
	- Patch t/Tree/001_root_node.t to test the above.
	- Rename Changes to CHANGES.
	- Use ini.report.pl (shipped with Module::Metadata::Changes) to add Changelog.ini to the distro.
	- Reformat the dates in this file.
	- Change lib/Tree/Fast.pm to Unix line endings.
	- Clean up the POD.
	- Re-work Makefile.PL rather than have Build.PL generate it.
	- Update pre-reqs in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
	- Move t/tests.pm to t/lib/Tests.pm.
