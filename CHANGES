Revision history for Perl distribution Tree.

1.04  Unreleased
	- Add README.

1.03  Fri Nov  2 09:34:00 2012
	- Rename Tree::Binary to Tree::Binary2 so it no longer clashes with the Tree::Binary shipped in the
		Tree-Binary distro. MetaCPAN was getting confused, and automatically redirected links to this
		module's Tree:Binary to the other one.

1.02  Thu Oct  4 12:10:00 2012
	- Ron Savage is now co-maint.
	- Patch Tree::Fast's value() to accept a defained value so the node's value can be set with
		$n -> value($new_value).
	- Patch Tree::Fast's meta() to accept a hashref so metadata can be set with $n -> meta({key => value}),
		as well as by directly accessing the internal hashref '_meta'.
	- Patch t/Tree/001_root_node.t to test the above.
	- Rename Changes to CHANGES.
	- Use ini.report.pl (shipped with Module::Metadata::Changes) to add Changelog.ini to the distro.
	- Reformat the dates in this file.
	- Change lib/Tree/Fast.pm to Unix line endings.
	- Clean up the POD.
	- Re-work Makefile.PL rather than have Build.PL generate it.
	- Update pre-reqs in Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
	- Move t/tests.pm to t/lib/Tests.pm.
